# My Repo
Great idea! A well-written "What We Learned" section in your README helps others understand the skills and concepts your team has gained from the project. Here's a sample you can include and edit based on your exact experience:

## 🧠 What We Learned

Through building the **Software Course Management System** using **Next.js** and **MongoDB**, we learned and applied a wide range of core software engineering and full-stack development concepts:

### 🔧 Full-Stack Web Development

* Designed and implemented a **full-stack application** using **Next.js (frontend & backend)** and **MongoDB (NoSQL database)**.
* Understood the **client-server model** and how to structure RESTful APIs.

### 🧱 Backend Development with MongoDB

* Created and managed multiple **MongoDB schemas and collections** (Faculty, Students, Sections, Projects, Milestones).
* Implemented **relationships between data** using Mongoose (like one-to-many, many-to-many).
* Performed **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) effectively.

### 🖥️ Frontend Development with Next.js & React

* Built dynamic and responsive **dashboard interfaces** using **React components** within Next.js.
* Used **hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`** to manage state and side effects.
* Integrated frontend forms with backend APIs for real-time interaction.

### 🔔 Notifications and File Handling

* Learned how to implement **automated and manual notifications**.
* Integrated **email sending logic** for reminders and updates.
* Built **file upload and categorization** features for organized resource sharing.

### 📚 Software Engineering Concepts

* Practiced **modular development** by breaking down the project into requirements and features.
* Understood **UML Class Diagram design** including concepts like generalization, aggregation, and multiplicity.
* Applied **role-based access control** for different user types (Faculty and Student).

### 🧪 Testing and Debugging

* Debugged API routes and data fetching in development mode.
* Performed unit-level testing manually to ensure feature stability.

### 🚀 Deployment & Version Control

* Used **Git** for version control and **GitHub** for project collaboration.
* Gained experience in **project planning, team coordination**, and milestone tracking.
